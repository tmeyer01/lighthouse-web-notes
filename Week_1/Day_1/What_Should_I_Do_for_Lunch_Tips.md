### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.



```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime", availableTime);
}
